# ðŸ”® Huddle01 Orb â€¢ [![test](https://github.com/orbland/orb/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/orbland/orb/actions/workflows/ci.yml) ![license](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-green.svg?label=license)

This is a fork of original [Orb](https://github.com/orbland/orb) supports video calls in 

The contract combines the following areas of functionality:

- **Orb and time-gated Video calls.** Allows the Keeper to have a video call via Huddle01 token-gated room with the Orb creator once a week in a predefined time slot.
- **Auction.** Allows the contract owner to start the Orb auction, determining the first Keeper of the Orb.
- **Funds management.** Allows any user to deposit and withdraw funds. Funds are used to make auction bids and pay Harberger Tax.
- **Harberger Tax.** Uses delayed accounting (settling) to allocate funds from the current Keeper to the contract beneficiary, based on the price set by the Keeper and tax rate.
- **ERC-721 compatibility.** All transfers revert, but otherwise, the contract appears as supporting all ERC-721 functions.
